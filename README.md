- ðŸŒ±**Packages Written (Favourite)**

      I have written Keys and Rbin packages in Bash/shell
     [**Keys**](https://github.com/anjibabuIITK/Keys-The_Password_Manager/releases/tag/1.0)
     
      "Keys" is a password manager to help a user to store and organize passwords.
      Keys manages and stores the passwords encrypted and locally, requiring the 
      user to create a master password: a single, strong password  which  grants 
      the user access to their entire password database. Keys protects the user's
      data using the AES-256-cbc encryption with salted format.
     [**Rbin**](https://github.com/anjibabuIITK/RECYCLEBIN_for_Linux/releases/tag/v1.0)
     
      RBIN is a simple and user-friendly package to act as a recycle-bin for Linux. 
      rbin can be a safe alternative for a rm command. Rbin moves the given files to
      recycle bin and restores them to their original location. It has the flexibility
      of setup the auto cleanup feature for every 30days. Users can control over auto-clean
      setting to off or change the period of days to clean etc when required.
